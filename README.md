## Features ✨

Based on the file name, the intended features likely include:

*   **Data Visualization:** Representing warehouse and retail sales data in a visually appealing format.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Allowing users to interact with the data and explore different aspects of sales performance.
*   **Report Generation:** Creating reports based on the sales data.
*   **Sales Analysis:** Analyzing sales trends and patterns.

**Note:** Since the actual implementation file is a `.docx`, these features are speculative and based on the file name. More specific features can be extracted by examining the contents of `excel report dashboard.docx`.

## Tech Stack 💻

*   **Microsoft Excel:** (Inferred from the `.docx` file, implying the use of Excel for dashboard creation)
*   **Potentially VBA:** (If the Excel dashboard contains macros or automated functionalities)

## How to Use 🚀

Unfortunately, there's no actual code to execute. However, the assumed usage based on the `.docx` file would be:

1.  **Open the `excel report dashboard.docx` file with Microsoft Excel.**
2.  **Enable Macros (if prompted):** If the dashboard contains macros, you may need to enable them for full functionality.
3.  **Interact with the Dashboard:** Use the interactive elements (charts, tables, slicers, etc.) to explore the sales data.
4.  **Generate Reports:** If the dashboard includes report generation features, use them to create reports based on the data.

**Real-world Use Cases**

*   **Retail Sales Performance Tracking:** A retail business can use the dashboard to monitor sales across different stores and product lines.
*   **Warehouse Inventory Management:** A warehouse can track inventory levels and sales to optimize stock and prevent shortages.
*   **Sales Trend Analysis:** A company can analyze sales trends over time to identify opportunities for growth and improvement.
